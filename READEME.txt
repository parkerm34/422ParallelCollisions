GITHUB TUTORIAL
================

Setup steps
-----------
- Go into directory where you want to store the project (eclipse workspace)
- type "git init" (without quotes)
- input the following command with URL
    git clone https://github.com/parkerm34/422ParallelCollisions.git

This will initialize your directory to be part of the working set.


To push your work
-----------------
- type in "git add ." or ("git add . --all" or "git add --all")
     within the parens I am not sure which is supposed to be used)
- type "git commit -m (your commit message here)"
- type git push
	(This one you may need to do git "push https://github.com/parkerm34/422ParallelCollisions.git" or something)

To pull work
------------
- type "git pull"
- hopefully there wont be any merge conflicts, if there are, thatll be a later lesson. If there are,
	then what you should do for now is to just store it on your local comp until I can give you a better
	tutorial. TL;DR on this step, we will be creating a fork or using a merging tool to figure it out.
